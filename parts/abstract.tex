\begin{Abstract}
Laparoscopy images exhibit artifacts like occlusion from surgical smoke, specular highlights, and noise. These artifacts hinders visibility, and degrades post processing (e.g. segmentation). We tackle these degradations as a novel \textit{unified Bayesian inference problem}. We propose \textit{probabilistic graphical models} and \textit{sparse dictionary models} as image priors. We obtain maximum-apriori probability (MAP) estimate by \textit{variational Bayesian expectation-maximization}. Results on simulated and real-world laparoscopy images show that our joint optimization strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art.
