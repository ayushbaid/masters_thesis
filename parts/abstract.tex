\begin{Abstract}
Laparoscopy images suffer from artifacts like surgical smoke, specular highlights, and noise. These artifacts hinder visibility, and degrade post processing (e.g. segmentation). There is a lack of literature on smoke removal in laparoscopy images, and to the best of our knowledge, no prior work on jointly tackling these three artifacts. We tackle these degradations as a novel \emph{unified Bayesian inference problem}. We use probabilistic graphical models and employ sparse dictionary priors and novel image intensity distribution priors. We obtain maximum-apriori probability (MAP) estimate by \emph{expectation maximization} and use variational Bayesian factorization to overcome the encountered intractabilities. Results on simulated and real-world laparoscopy images show that our joint optimization strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art.
