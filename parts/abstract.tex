\begin{Abstract}
Laparoscopy images exhibit artifacts like occlusion from surgical smoke, specular highlights, and noise. These artifacts hinders visibility, and degrades post processing (e.g. segmentation). There is a lack of literature on smoke removal in laparoscopy images, and to the best of our knowledge, no prior work on jointly tackling these three artifacts. We tackle these degradations as a novel \textit{unified Bayesian inference problem}. We use \textit{probabilistic graphical models} and employ \textit{sparse dictionary models} and novel \textit{image intensity distribution model} as image priors. We obtain maximum-apriori probability (MAP) estimate by \textbf{expectation maximization} and use variational Bayesian factorization to overcome the encountered intractabilities. Results on simulated and real-world laparoscopy images show that our joint optimization strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art.
