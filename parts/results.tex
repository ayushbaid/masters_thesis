\chapter{Results}

In this chapter, we compare our methods with the existing literature. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work on joint removal of smoke, speckle, and noise in laparoscopy images. We combine multiple methods which solve the subproblems and use them for end-to-end comparison. We use anisotropic diffusion for inpainting which preserves texture better than isotropic diffusion used in laparoscopy imaging \cite{saint2011detection, arnold2010speckle}. The methods used for comparison are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Desmoking and denoising with adaptive wiener filtering by Gibson ICIP13 \cite{gibson2013wiener}, followed by anisotropic diffusion inpainting.
    \item Noise removal with edge preserving bilateral filtering, followed by smoke removal with He PAMI11 \cite{he2011dark} and anisotropic diffusion inpainting.
\end{enumerate}

We observe the qualitative aspect of output images such as texture, presence of noise, and accuracy and naturalness of colors in the output. We also use 4 quantitative measures, which are (1) relative root mean square difference (RRMSE); (2)sum of channel-wise mean structure similarity index measure (SSIM) across RGB channels; (3) sum of channel-wise mean quality index based on local variance (QILV) across RGB channels; (4) sum of channel-wise chi-squared distance between histograms along the 3 channels in the LMS colorspace. These metrics cover a wide range of features such as noise level, blur, structure, and color distribution. RRMSE, chi-squared distance should be low and QILV, SSIM should be high for the best method.

We present examples and quantitative metrics by processing synthetically corrupted simulated data and high quality laparoscopy data in the following sections.

\section{Experiment details}
Proposed as well as competing methods are tuned for best performance at 3 percent noise level. Our method has three free parameters ($\gamma_1$,  $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$) which are to be tuned. For synthetic corruption, we use 3 transmission coefficient maps and 20 specularity maps. We get 3 times 5 transmission coefficient maps using 5 scalar multiples or smoke levels. We add i.i.d. Gaussian noise of standard deviation ranging from 0 \% to 7\%.

We use this experiment to provide proof on concept of our method. The simulated data is designed to provide basis of evaluation in terms of image texture and color. We use 6 noise levels, 3 smoke maps, and 5 smoke levels. This results in 90 experiments.

An example of processing on synthetically corrupted phantom is \Figref{fig:imagesPhantom1}. Gibson ICIP13 \cite{gibson2013wiener} plus inpainting does a poor job at removing smoke. Bilateral filtering, He PAMI11 \cite{he2011dark} plus inpainting does a decent job at desmoking, but the inpainting performance is poor. Our dictionary prior does a better job of filling in texture. Proposed method VBEM has the best removal of smoke, better texture and colors.

We perform quantitative benchmarking using 4 metrics. The results are presented in \Figref{fig:resultsQuantSimulated}. Our proposed method has better performance across all metrics. RRMSE and QILV metric in particular demonstrate robustness to high smoke concentration and high noise level.

\section{Synthetic corruption on high quality laparoscopy images}
We now perform validation on laparoscopy data. We take high quality laparoscopy images, corrupt them synthetically, and then process using different algorithms and compare the outputs with the ground truth. We run experiments on 6 image, where each image is corrupted with 90 different corruption combinations.

\Figref{fig:imagesPgt1}, \Figref{fig:imagesPgt2}, \Figref{fig:imagesPgt3}, and \Figref{fig:imagesPgt4} show the results of processing on laparoscopy data. \Figref{fig:imagesPgt1} and \Figref{fig:imagesPgt2} demonstrate better noise removal while maintaining sharper texture.\Figref{fig:imagesPgt3} is an example of better speckle removal by our method. \Figref{fig:imagesPgt4} demonstrated higher contrast and better colors after smoke removal. These observations are similar to those for simulated data. Gibson ICIP13 \cite{gibson2013wiener} does not remove satisfactory levels of smoke. Bilateral filtering, He PAMI11 \cite{he2011dark} plus inpainting does a decent job at smoke removal, but the result produces unnatural color in certain examples. Bilateral filter also leads to loss of edges and texture. The inpainting of specular highlights has clear seams in certain regions, and the filled regions lack texture. Proposed method VBEM has the best removal of smoke, better texture and colors. Quantitative evaluation in \Figref{fig:resultsPgtSimulated} demonstrates that we perform better for each metric.

\section{Real world laparoscopy images}
We present some results of proposed method VBEM and other competing algorithms on real world laparoscopy images. \Figref{fig:resultsObs1} demonstrates better texture in our output. \Figref{fig:resultsObs2} and \Figref{fig:resultsObs3} demonstrate better color accuracy after smoke removal. Finally, we demonstrate some results on speckle removal in \Figref{fig:resultsObs4}.

From the examples, we observed that our method generates natural colors after removing smoke, preserved texture while removing equal amounts of noise, and performs better filling of speckles.
