\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

Our proposed algorithm VBEM does a better job at removing smoke, specular highlight, and noise than the compared sequential methods. We produce natural colors after haze removal, preserve texture after removing noise, fill in better and sharp details in the holes created by specular highlight. These claims are supported by qualitative examples, as well as the metrics.

Our work can be extended by application on temporal sequences. The priors can be constructed in an online manner, using the temporal information. Our developments can be tried on different class of images and the performance can be evaluated.
